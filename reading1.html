  <h2>Reading 1: "In Plato’s Cave" – Susan Sontag</h2>

  <p>
    In “In Plato’s Cave,” Susan Sontag explores the power of photography and
    how image-making shapes the way we understand reality. She argues that
    photographs are not neutral records of the world but are framed, selected,
    and interpreted representations. I was especially struck by her idea that
    taking a photograph can feel like an act of control. In today’s digital
    culture, we constantly document our lives, but we rarely question how that
    documentation changes our experience of reality.

  <p>
    Sontag suggests that photography can distance us from direct experience.
    Instead of fully engaging with the world, we often experience events through
    the lens of a camera. This made me reflect on how often I prioritize capturing
    an image over being present in the moment. At the same time, photography can
    also preserve memory and create powerful social commentary. In my own work,
    I want to be more intentional about how I frame and present images, thinking
    critically about what is included, excluded, and emphasized.
