  <h1>Reading Response #2</h1>

  <p>
    Reading: <em>With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster</em> by Nesrine Malik
  </p>

  <p>
    500-word reflection due Fri 2/27
  </p>

  <p>
    This response should not be a summary. Instead, analyze the author’s main argument and reflect on how you connect to the ideas in the article.
  </p>

  <p>
    In your 500+ word reflection, identify the key themes Malik discusses about AI-generated content, digital media, and the distortion of reality. Apply terminology from our lectures and slides when appropriate. You should demonstrate that you understand the broader theoretical issues surrounding authorship, representation, visual culture, mediation, or design ethics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Critically evaluate the author’s claims. Do you agree or disagree? Why? How does this article change the way you think about images, information, and media production today? What responsibilities do designers and media makers have in this environment?
  </p>

  <p>
    Post your completed reflection to your website and make sure it is clearly linked from your readings page.
