  <h1>Homework 3: Depth of Field</h1>

  <p>
    For Homework 3, I posted 4 JPG images total on this single page (homework3.html):
    a shallow depth of field photo, a deep depth of field photo, a Photoshop blur version,
    and the original image used for the blur comparison. All images are under 2 MB and saved
    in the <b>images</b> folder.
  </p>

  <h2>1 & 2: In-camera shallow vs. deep depth of field</h2>

  <table role="presentation" style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:12px;">
    <tr>
      <th>Shallow DoF</th>
      <th>Deep DoF</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;">
        <img src="images/shallow.jpg" alt="Shallow Depth of Field" width="300" />
        <p>
          Settings (example): f/2.8, 1/400s, ISO 100. Subject is sharp and background is blurred.
        </p>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;">
        <img src="images/deep.jpg" alt="Deep Depth of Field" width="300" />
        <p>
          Settings (example): f/11, 1/125s, ISO 200. Foreground and background appear sharp.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>3 & 4: Photoshop blur vs. original image (comparison)</h2>

  <table role="presentation" style="border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:12px;">
    <tr>
      <th>Photoshop Blur (Blur Gallery)</th>
      <th>Original</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;">
        <img src="images/photoshopblur.jpg" alt="Photoshop shallow depth of field using Blur Gallery" width="300" />
        <p>
          I used Filter &gt; Blur Gallery &gt; Field Blur to blur the background while keeping the subject sharp.
        </p>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align:top;text-align:center;">
        <img src="images/original.jpg" alt="Original image used for Photoshop blur comparison" width="300" />
        <p>
          This is the original image before applying the Blur Gallery filter.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>

  <h2>Reflection (about 250 words)</h2>
  <p>
    Write your reflection here. Explain what you were trying to photograph, what you learned about shallow
    versus deep depth of field, how aperture/f-stop affected your results, and what you did in Photoshop to
    create an artificial depth of field effect. Also describe any Camera Raw adjustments you made (exposure,
    clipping warnings, histogram, straightening) and why you made those changes.
